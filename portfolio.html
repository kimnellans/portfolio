                <p>Bridging the Gap with Digital Solutions</p>
                <blockquote>‚ÄúI love supporting local farmers, but without a car, it's been nearly impossible to get
                    fresh
                    produce from the market.‚Äù</blockquote>

            <div>
                <h3>In the heart of Boise, Idaho, an established tradition, the Boise Farmers Market (BFM), thrives as a
                    community pillar. It connects local farmers to their patrons, providing fresh, locally-grown produce
                    directly to consumers. When the pandemic emerged, accessibility became a growing issue, rendering a
                    chunk of the population unable to participate in this vibrant exchange.</h3>
                <p>The BFM's response? An online ordering and drive-thru option, a timely solution that preserved the
                    connection between farmers and patrons. Yet, a significant problem remained. Those unable to visit
                    the
                    market or align their schedules with the restrictive pickup window found themselves excluded from
                    this
                    local food-centric experience. People without transportation, mobility issues, or schedule conflicts
                    were particularly affected.</p>
                <p>This led to the realization that while the drive-thru option improved accessibility for some, it
                    still
                    left out those with various limitations. The challenge became: How to evolve this local staple into
                    a
                    platform accessible to everyone, with a focus on delivery to address these issues?</p>

                <h2>The Challenge: Nourishing Local Communities</h2>
                <p>Addressing Accessibility and Mobility Issues</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The main problem my design aimed to solve was the disconnect between local farmers and consumers,
                    particularly those who were excluded due to transportation, mobility, or scheduling issues. The goal
                    of
                    the Locavore app was to create a digital solution that would enable these consumers to find local
                    farmers, view inventory, place orders, and opt for delivery, all within a seamless user interface.
                </h3>
                <p>While the design also considered the need for farmers to manage their inventory effectively and
                    connect
                    directly with consumers, the primary focus of this iteration was on the delivery option, addressing
                    the
                    main pain point and serving as the MVP for the project.</p>
                <p>This problem posed a considerable risk - community members missing out on fresh, local produce and
                    local
                    farmers losing a larger customer base. I saw an opportunity here, a chance to bridge this gap and
                    create
                    an inclusive solution that not just serves but flourishes within the community.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the People</h2>
                <h3>The primary patrons of Locavore are people who value fresh, local produce and the farmers who supply
                    it.
                    To delve into the needs and challenges of these distinct groups, comprehensive research was
                    conducted,
                    encompassing surveys and interviews.</h3>
                <p>Patrons: The research focused on understanding their shopping habits, motivations, and challenges in
                    buying local produce, along with their comfort level with digital platforms. The insights revealed a
                    strong desire for fresh local produce but highlighted the need for a people-friendly digital
                    solution.
                </p>
                <p>Farmers: For farmers, the study centered on their current inventory management methods, challenges in
                    reaching patrons, and comfort with digital platforms. The need for an efficient way to communicate
                    available products to customers was a key insight.</p>
