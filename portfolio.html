                <h2>The Challenge: Nourishing Local Communities</h2>
                <p>Addressing Accessibility and Mobility Issues</p>
                <blockquote>‚ÄúI love supporting local farmers, but without a car, it's been nearly impossible to get fresh produce from the market.‚Äù</blockquote>
                <cite>‚Äî BFM MARKET PATRON</cite>

            <div class="right-column">
                <p>In the heart of Boise, Idaho, an established tradition, the Boise Farmers Market (BFM), thrives as a community pillar. It connects local farmers to their patrons, providing fresh, locally-grown produce directly to consumers. When the pandemic emerged, accessibility became a growing issue, rendering a chunk of the population unable to participate in this vibrant exchange.</p>
                <p>The BFM's response? An online ordering and drive-thru option, a timely solution that preserved the connection between farmers and patrons. Yet, a significant problem remained. Those unable to visit the market or align their schedules with the restrictive pickup window found themselves excluded from this local food-centric experience. People without transportation, mobility issues, or schedule conflicts were particularly affected.</p>
                <p>This led to the realization that while the drive-thru option improved accessibility for some, it still left out those with various limitations. The challenge became: How to evolve this local staple into a platform accessible to everyone, with a focus on delivery to address these issues?</p>

                <h3>Understanding the People</h3>
                <p>The primary patrons of Locavore are people who value fresh, local produce and the farmers who supply it. To delve into the needs and challenges of these distinct groups, comprehensive research was conducted, encompassing surveys and interviews.</p>
                <p>Patrons: The research focused on understanding their shopping habits, motivations, and challenges in buying local produce, along with their comfort level with digital platforms. The insights revealed a strong desire for fresh local produce but highlighted the need for a people-friendly digital solution.</p>
                <p>Farmers: For farmers, the study centered on their current inventory management methods, challenges in reaching patrons, and comfort with digital platforms. The need for an efficient way to communicate available products to customers was a key insight.</p>
