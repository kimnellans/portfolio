                Idaho</p>
            <p>My Role: Product Designer- Responsible for the entire UX / UI process.</p>
            <p>Timeline: 3 Months (June - August 2023)</p>
            <p>Objective: To foster community engagement by making fresh, locally sourced food accessible to all in
                Boise, Idaho.</p>
            <p>Constraints: Limited by the conceptual nature of the project, with constraints on metrics and outcomes.

            <h2>Introduction: Connecting Farmers and Patrons</h2>
            <p>Bridging the Gap with Digital Solutions</p>
            <blockquote>‚ÄúI love supporting local farmers, but without a car, it's been nearly impossible to get fresh
                produce from the market.‚Äù</blockquote>

            <h3>In the heart of Boise, Idaho, an established tradition, the Boise Farmers Market (BFM), thrives as a
                community pillar. It connects local farmers to their patrons, providing fresh, locally-grown produce
                directly to consumers. When the pandemic emerged, accessibility became a growing issue, rendering a
                chunk of the population unable to participate in this vibrant exchange.</h3>
            <p>The BFM's response? An online ordering and drive-thru option, a timely solution that preserved the
                connection between farmers and patrons. Yet, a significant problem remained. Those unable to visit the
                market or align their schedules with the restrictive pickup window found themselves excluded from this
                local food-centric experience. People without transportation, mobility issues, or schedule conflicts
                were particularly affected.</p>
            <p>This led to the realization that while the drive-thru option improved accessibility for some, it still
                left out those with various limitations. The challenge became: How to evolve this local staple into a
                platform accessible to everyone, with a focus on delivery to address these issues?</p>

            <p>Addressing Accessibility and Mobility Issues</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>The main problem my design aimed to solve was the disconnect between local farmers and consumers,
                particularly those who were excluded due to transportation, mobility, or scheduling issues. The goal of
                the Locavore app was to create a digital solution that would enable these consumers to find local
                farmers, view inventory, place orders, and opt for delivery, all within a seamless user interface.</h3>
            <p>While the design also considered the need for farmers to manage their inventory effectively and connect
                directly with consumers, the primary focus of this iteration was on the delivery option, addressing the
                main pain point and serving as the MVP for the project.</p>
            <p>This problem posed a considerable risk - community members missing out on fresh, local produce and local
                farmers losing a larger customer base. I saw an opportunity here, a chance to bridge this gap and create
                an inclusive solution that not just serves but flourishes within the community.</p>

            <h3>The primary patrons of Locavore are people who value fresh, local produce and the farmers who supply it.
                To delve into the needs and challenges of these distinct groups, comprehensive research was conducted,
                encompassing surveys and interviews.</h3>
            <p>Patrons: The research focused on understanding their shopping habits, motivations, and challenges in
                buying local produce, along with their comfort level with digital platforms. The insights revealed a
                strong desire for fresh local produce but highlighted the need for a people-friendly digital solution.
            </p>
            <p>Farmers: For farmers, the study centered on their current inventory management methods, challenges in
                reaching patrons, and comfort with digital platforms. The need for an efficient way to communicate
                available products to customers was a key insight.</p>
